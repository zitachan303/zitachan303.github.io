			<h1>Can It Stop? –Our Everlasting Struggle with Epidemic </h1>
			<section>
				At the beginning of 2020, an <b>unknown threat</b> to human’s health emerged in China and soon spread to the entire globe rapidly. A new type of coronavirus, also known as <u>COVID-19</u>, is highly contagious and causes serious respiratory disease, which has so far killed thousands of people in more than 200 countries. Moreover, the accompanying shrinking production and consumption has led to the largest global recession since the Great Depression. As experts are still looking for solutions, we could learn a lesson from the history of humankind, which is never short of examples of worldwide epidemics, <s>although it is not very likely to be successful.</s>
			<h2><em>How did we deal with pandemics? </em></h2> 
			<section>
				Back to the ancient world, serious plagues had been documented such as the <u>Epic of Gilgamesh or the Old Testament of Bible.</u> But the earliest one of well-known epidemics must be the Black Death, which broke out in the Middle Age and killed almost one third of the population of Europe. At that time, the lack of hygiene knowledge made it hard to cut down the access of spreading and protect people against the disease. 
				<sub>For instance, people in the Middle Ages almost had no knowledge about microbes, let alone Yersinia Pestis, a bacterium mostly carried by rats, which is able to spread the Black Death among people.</sub> Instead, they tended to view the disease as the punishment of God or some supernatural power, which was a false belief that prevented patients from getting proper treatment. Despite lacking limited hygiene knowledge, some useful methods had come up at that time, such as quarantine. In Venice, every ship was required to spend forty days in a restricted place before entering the port <small>in case there were potential patients on the ship.</small> It indicated that people had the concept of sequestering the ill people from the healthy ones, which is still the core idea of defeating most epidemics today.
