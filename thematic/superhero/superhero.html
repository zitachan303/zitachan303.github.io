	 		<h2>Plot:</h2>
	 		<p>
	 			The movie is a 2016 American Superhero film directed by Scott Derrickson. Dr. Stephen Strange is a wealthy and authoritative neurosurgeon who injures his hand in a car crash. He finds Karl Mordo who is a master of Mystic Art to heal his hand. She gives her magic power to Strange so that he can use his hand again. Under her training, Strange is able to use magic power and use his hand skilfully. He realizes that Kaecilius who once was Mordo’s student wants to contact Dormammu who is the Dark Dimension and is powerful enough to destroy the earth. In order to protect the Earth, Strange decides to help Mordo to fight against Kaecilius and Dormammu. He uses the Eye Agamotto, which contains time loop function, to fight against Dormammu, and he eventually wins the war. </br>
				Review:</br>
				After watching the movie, there are two most memorable scenes that inspire me a lot. The first scene is that when Strange is willing to give up his high salary job and become a gradient of the Earth. Before being a gradient, he has everything that everyone desires for, like money, authority, and friends. When Mordo ask him to choose either go back to be a neurosurgeon or become a gradient, he confused but he still choose to be a gradient, leaving his comfort zone. In my opinion, leaving the comfort zone is the most difficult decision in life. In the zone, we are familiar with everything and people that make us feel a sense of security. Leaving comfort zone means we have to face the new environment and people. We need to spend time to adapt the new environment, and face the failure, which may make us feel helpless, uncomfortable, and not confident. Strange’s action inspires me that leaving the comfort zone is difficult, but it also a chance to challenge myself and border my horizon from different people and situation. </br>
				Another scene is that when Strange keep using time loop to fight against Dormammu. Dormmammu gives up destroying the earth because he is unable to tolerate Strange use the unlimited time looping to fight against him. No matter how he kills Strange, Strange use the time loop and challenge again. However, time is limited is the reality. Everything only has one chance. Past is past, time will never return. As time is limited, we should always cherish our time and take time to do things we desire. Never wait until time is gone. </br>
