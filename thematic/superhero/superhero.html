	 		<h2>Plot:</h2>
	 		<p>
	 			The movie is a 2016 American Superhero film directed by Scott Derrickson. Dr. Stephen Strange is a wealthy and authoritative neurosurgeon who injures his hand in a car crash. He finds Karl Mordo who is a master of Mystic Art to heal his hand. She gives her magic power to Strange so that he can use his hand again. Under her training, Strange is able to use magic power and use his hand skilfully. He realizes that Kaecilius who once was Mordo’s student wants to contact Dormammu, who is the Dark Dimension and is powerful enough to destroy the earth. In order to protect the Earth, Strange decides to help Mordo to fight against Kaecilius and Dormammu. He uses the Eye Agamotto, which contains time loop functions, to fight against Dormammu, and he eventually wins the war. </br>
				Review:</br>
				After watching the movie, there are two most memorable scenes that inspire me a lot. The first scene is that when Strange is willing to give up his high salary job and become a gradient of the Earth. Before being a gradient, he has everything that everyone desires for, like money, authority, and friends. When Mordo asks him to choose either go back to be a neurosurgeon or become a gradient, he confused, but he still choose to be a gradient, leaving his comfort zone. In my opinion, leaving the comfort zone is the most difficult decision in life. In the zone, we are familiar with everything and people that make us feel a sense of security. Leaving the comfort zone means we have to face the new environment and people. We need to spend time to adapt the new environment, and face the failure, which may make us feel helpless, uncomfortable, and not confident. Strange’s action inspires me that leaving the comfort zone is difficult, but it is also a chance to challenge myself and border my horizon from different people and situation. </br>
				Another scene is that when Strange keep using a time loop to fight against Dormammu. Dormammu gives up destroying the earth because he is unable to tolerate Strange use the unlimited time looping to fight against him. No matter how he kills Strange, Strange use the time loop and challenge again. However, time is limited is the reality. Everything only has one chance. Past is past, time will never return. As time is limited, we should always cherish our time and take time to do things we desire. Never wait until time is gone. </br>
				這部電影是由斯科特·德里克森（Scott Derrickson）執導的2016年美國超級英雄電影。 Stephen Strange博士是一位富有且權威的神經外科醫生，在車禍中受傷。他尋求大師卡爾·莫爾多（Karl Mordo）醫治了他的手。她賦予自己的魔力給，使他可以靈活地使用他的手。在她的訓練下，Strange學會了魔法力量。在圖書館閱讀的過程他發現Kaecilius想召喚黑暗魔王的Dormammu，去摧毀地球。為了保護地球，決定幫助Mordo與Kaecilius和Dormammu對抗。Strange最終以具有時間循環功能的魔法道具去對抗Dormammu，並獲得勝利，贏得了這場戰爭。</br>
				評論：</br>
				看完電影后，有兩個最令我很難忘的場面。第一個是，當Strange願意放棄他的高薪工作而成為地球的守護者。在成為守護者之前，他擁有每個人都想要的一切，例如金錢，權威和朋友。當Mordo讓他選擇重回原來生活成為神經外科醫生還是成為地球的守護者時，他仍然選擇成為地球的守護者，離開了自己的舒適圈。我認為離開舒適圈是很困難的選擇，因為這代表我們要面對新的環境。在適應的過程中，我們會面對很多失敗，這會使我們感到無助和挫敗。但同時也是一個挑戰自我並與不同人相處境的機會。
				另一個場面是，當Strange繼續使用時間循環與Dormammu對抗時。 Dormmammu最終放棄了毀滅地球是因為他無法容忍Strange使用無限的時間倒流來對抗他。無論他如何殺死Strange，Strange都會使用時間倒流並再次挑戰。時間倒流是大家都有過的慾望，但我們都知道時間是有限。所有東西都只有一次機會。過去就是過去，時間永遠不會回來。正因為時間有限，我們更應該珍惜時間，去做自己想要的事情。不要等到時間流逝才後悔。</br>
