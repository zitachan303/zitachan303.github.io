	 			<h1>Hidden Figures</h1>
	 			<h2>Plot:</h2>
	 			<p>
	 				Hidden Figures is a 2016 American Biographical Film directed by Theodore Melfi. The film based on the real story of Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan. Katherine Johnson was the mathematician, Mary Jackson was the mathematician and engineer, and Dorothy Vaughan was the mathematician and supervisor. Both of them worked in NASA. </br>
	 				The movie took place in 1960s of America. 1960s were not only during the cold war, but also during racial segregation in America. Katherine, Mary, Dorothy are talented at mathematics, which motivated them to work at NASA. Unfortunately, they are not allowed to work at the important position because they are coloured. Every bathroom, canteen, department are divided into white people and coloured people. Black people have been constantly discriminated against by the white people and suffered unequal treatment. Although Katherine, Mary, Dorothy are in the unequal situation, they try their best to succeed and never spend in stagnation. They later made a great contribution to America.

	 			<h2>Review:</h2>
	 			<p>	
	 				After watching the movie, I feel sad for the suffering of black people due to racism. In the movie, Katherine, Mary and Dorothy used their knowledge to help them get a job from NASA, where the smartest engineer and mathematician are. They proved that the black people can be as smart as the whites. Unfortunately, no matter how smart they are, they still suffered in a serious discrimination from the white people. Take Dorothy as an example, she did the work that a supervisor has to do but she still cannot successfully apply to be a supervisor of the computer department. It is because she is a coloured person; she is no allowed to have higher rank than the whites. Mary in the movie mentioned that “every time we have a chance to get ahead, they move the finish line.” Therefore, the black people are discriminated seriously by the whites.

	 				The movie no only shows the audience about the racial segregation that occurs in 1960s, but also shows that we should always keep our faith and never yield to the incorrect things and situation. In the movie, Dorothy and her children are not allowed to take the books out of the library because they are coloured people. But Dorothy takes it and explains to her children that she does not steal the book. She is also a taxpayer who should have the same rights as the white people. Dorothy said “separation and equality are two things. Just because it’s the way don’t make it right.” Therefore, we should judge right and wrong by ourselves.
