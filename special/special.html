				<h1>Summer Program</h1>
				In the summer vacation of 2020, I participated in a summer program which aims to consolidate the knowledge of elementary school students. I am in charge of 5 students at Castle Peak Elementary School. In the program, I encountered a lot of difficulties, but I also gained a lot of experience.</br>
				在2020年的暑假中，我參加了一個暑期計劃，旨在鞏固小學生的知識。我負責5名青山小學的學生。在過程中，我遇到了很多困難，但是我也獲得了很多經驗。</br>
				The first challenge is to plan a class schedule for students. Since I never teach elementary school students, I feel confused about their study materials. Fortunately, the teacher from that elementary school gave some study materials to me. Following the guideline, I prepare some exercises for the students. Planning a class schedule is difficult because I have to put myself in and think whether those exercises will be too difficult for them. Instead of preparing the exercises, I have to create different activities which foster students to pay attention in class. I found some interesting video clips with English subtitles for students to watch during the break time. But students feel bored about the videos as they cannot completely understand the content of the clips. To solve this, I ask my friend who also joined this program before for some advices. As I follow her advices to find the clips that suitable for students’ level, students seem to be more interested in those videos clips. Planning study schedule and preparing activities for students really make me feel exhausted. But I also feel delighted as I gain many precious experience.</br>
				第一個挑戰是為學生設計課程表。由於我沒有教過小學生，因此我不知道要準備甚麼學習材料才符合他們的程度。設計課程表其實很困難，因為我要去思考這些練習對他們來說是否太難。除了準備練習之外，我有設計各種活動來引起學生對上課的興趣。我找到一些有趣的影片給學生在休息時間觀看。但學生對影片沒有太大的興趣，因為他們沒辦法理解影片的內容。為了解決這個問題，我請我的朋友提供一些建議。參考她的建議後，我去找適合學生水平的影片。學生之後對這些視頻片段比之前更興趣。因此，我認為設計課程表和準備活動是一件很花心思的事情。但是我也很高興，因為我也得到很多珍貴的經驗。</br>
				The second challenge is to manage students’ emotion. Not every student can sit on the chair and wait until the class dismissed. I remember that there is a student who likes to walk around the classroom. Although I asked him to sit down, he did not listen to me. To solve this, I try to give them more break time so that they can pay attention to class. Also, some of the students slept in class. To solve this, I try to play games with them. When they answer my questions, I gave them candy as a prize. This actually motivates them to pay attention in class. </br>
				
				第二個挑戰是管理學生的情緒。並非每個學生會一直坐在椅子上直到下課。我記得有一個學生喜歡在教室裡走來走去。儘管我請他坐下，但他也不理會我。為了解決這個問題，我嘗試給他們更多的休息時間。另外，有些學生會在上課的時候睡覺。為了解決這個問題，我嘗試與他們一起玩遊戲。當他們回答我的問題時，我給了他們糖果作為獎勵，從而讓他們專注於課堂。</br>
				After this program, I learn to get along and communicate with children. In addition, I believe that my problem-solving skills are improved. Overall, I feel delighted that I have joined this program. And I am willing to join this program next year.
				計劃結束後，我學會與孩子們相處並與他們溝通。另外，我的解決問題的能力也有所提升。總體而言，我很高興加入了這個計劃。</br>
