				<h1>Summer Program</h1>
				In the summer vacation of 2020, I participated in a summer course aimed at consolidating the knowledge of elementary school students. I am in charge of 5 students for 3 hours at Castle Peak Primary School every weekend. During the planning period, I encountered a lot of difficulties, but I also gained a lot of experience.</br>
				在2020年的暑假中，我參加了旨在鞏固小學生知識的暑期課程。每個週末，我在青山小學負責5個學生3個小時的學習。在計劃期間，我遇到了很多困難，但是我也獲得了很多經驗</br>
				First, the first challenge is to plan a suitable class schedule for students. Since I never teach elementary school students, I am not clear about what they are learning now. Fortunately, the teacher in that elementary school introduced me to the scope of study of third grade students. According to the scope of study, I prepare some exercises that suit my level. I think planning is difficult because I have to stand aside and see if the practice is too difficult for them to understand. In addition to preparing for the practice, I must also carry out various activities to guide students to pay attention and discover interest in the course. First, I want to find some interesting English video clips for students to watch during the break. Since I don’t have the latest information about the favorites of elementary school students, I sometimes find these videos, which makes students feel bored. In order to increase their interest, I even found a lot of information and asked them what they thought of the video. Therefore, I think that setting a learning schedule is indeed a challenge, especially for those who have no experience.</br>
				首先，第一個挑戰是為學生計劃合適的上課時間表。由於我從不教小學生，所以我不清楚他們現在在學什麼。幸運的是，那所小學的老師向我介紹了三年級學生的學習範圍。根據學習範圍，我準備一些適合自己水平的練習。我認為計劃很困難，因為我必須站在一邊，看看這種做法對他們來說是否太難理解。除了為練習做準備之外，我還必須開展各種活動，以引導學生注意和發現對課程的興趣。首先，我想找到一些有趣的英語視頻片段，供學生在課間休息時觀看。由於我沒有有關小學生喜愛的最新信息，因此有時我會找到這些視頻，這使學生感到無聊。為了增加他們的興趣發現了很多信息，並詢問他們對視頻的看法。因此，我認為製定學習時間表確實是一個挑戰，特別是對於那些沒有經驗的人。</br>
				The second challenge is to manage the emotions and order of the students. Before being fired in class, not every student would sit in a chair according to my instructions. I remember a student who also liked to leave the chair and walk around in the classroom. Even if I ask him to sit down, he will not listen to me every time. To solve this problem, I try to give them more rest time so that they can pay attention to class and listen to my instructions during class. In addition, some students don't want to go to class, so they sleep during class. In order to solve this problem, I try to play games with them. When they answer my question, I will give them candy. This actually motivates them to focus on the classroom.</br>
				
				第二個挑戰是管理學生的情緒和秩序。在上課之前，並不是每個學生都會按照我的指示坐在椅子上。我記得一個學生，他也喜歡離開椅子，在教室裡走來走去。即使我請他坐下，他也不會每次都聽我說。為了解決這個問題，我嘗試給他們更多的休息時間，以便他們可以注意上課並在上課時聽我的指示。另外，有些學生不想上課，所以他們在上課時睡覺。為了解決這個問題，我嘗試與他們一起玩遊戲。當他們回答我的問題時，我會給他們糖果。這實際上激勵他們專注於課堂。</br>
				After finishing the course, I learn how to get along and communicate with the children. In addition, I believe that after encountering many challenges in class, my problem-solving ability has been improved. Overall, I am very happy to join the program. I am willing to participate in the program next year.
				完成課程後，我將學習如何與孩子們相處和溝通。另外，我相信在課堂上遇到很多挑戰之後，我的解決問題的能力得到了提高。總體而言，我很高興加入該計劃。我願意參加明年的計劃。</br>
