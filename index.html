			<h1><u>Autobiography</u></h1>
			<section>
				My Chinese name is Chan Hiu-Laam, and “Zita” is my English name. I was born in Hong Kong, which is a city full of energy and enthusiasm. I have always been proud to be a Hongkonger. I live with my precious family members. My mother is a teacher, my father is an engineer, and my brother is an undergraduate student. In my family, “being healthy” is the most important thing, which is my family’s motto. My family, especially my mother, do many exercises and eat healthy food to keep them healthy. We enjoy hiking different mountains in every weekend. We believe that we must have a healthy body if we want to success. Owing to the influence of my parents, I usually exercise at least once a week.
