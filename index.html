					My Chinese name is Chan Hiu-Laam, and “Zita” is my English name. I was born in Hong Kong, which is a city full of energy and enthusiasm. I have always been proud to be a Hongkonger. I live with my precious family members. My mother is a teacher, my father is an engineer, and my brother and I are undergraduate students. In my family, “being healthy” is the most important thing, which is my family’s motto. We like to hike different mountains every weekend. A healthy body is the first step to success. Because of my parents, I like exercising too.

					I am a year four undergraduate student who studies at the Department of Foreign Language and Literature (FLL) in National Tsing Hua University. Being a FLL student, I have to take the courses on both linguistic and literature. I have learned a lot in these courses. After the courses, I learn to use the IPA symbols to show the pronunciation of the word. For instance, the IPA symbol of “take” is [teɪk]. Studying linguistic helps me to analyse different languages. After taking literature course, I learn more about the ancient history and value, which is useful to improve critical thinking.

					Alternatively, I have joined the Glow Performance Club and have become one of the club cadres. In the club, senior students teach freshmen various performance skills of using the stick with LED lights. Once we learn all the skills, we are able to perform on stage. Therefore, I believe that the experience of performing on stage make me more confident and have courage to face challenges in different situation.

					Playing piano is one of my hobbies. The first time I played piano was when I was six-year-old. I have been playing the piano for ten years. I love piano, however, I often feel exhausted after spending a lot of time for practicing. The average practice time is about three hours, which means I have to sit in front of the piano for at least three hour. Even I feel bored about the long hours of practice; I still always force myself to pay attention on the piano. Playing piano can really improve my concentration and will not be distracted by other unimportant things.
